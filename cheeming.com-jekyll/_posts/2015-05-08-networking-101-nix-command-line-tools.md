title: Networking 101 with *nix Command Line Tools
---
We try to do some sharing sessions at [Infinite Code](http://infinite-code.com/), once/twice monthly to share with some things learned, mostly on Fridays.

Today, I did a sharing session on some networking basics with command line tools with ssh, telnet, lsof, nc and etc. I created a Google Drive document that includes some notes on what we talked about.

Check it out below:
