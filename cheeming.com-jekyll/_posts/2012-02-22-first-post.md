Hello there! This is my first post on my new blog which is currently powered by jekyll. I have always been using those database-driven-type-of-blog systems and I always thought they are a bit too cumbersome for me. These systems are able to do much quickly but overtime the maintenance of it seems a bit too much for me. I just want to focus on writing!

Currently my blog runs on top of Amazon S3 and jekyll fits well into the setup since it is just spitting out static files. I will blog more about how I set this site up so that I can remember what I actually did :D.
